# EGoSpace
This is a website project, with Java for the backend and Vue for the frontend. I am still pushing forward at the moment!
EGoSpace is equivalent to E-purchase space, and the Chinese pronunciation of "è´­" is equivalent to the English word "Go". For me personally, this project is about learning together and achieving results, which is the most important thing.
